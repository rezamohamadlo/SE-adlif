# SSC_DTH_SE_adLIF Training Summary — Seed 42

This file is updated automatically whenever training saves a new best checkpoint.

## Run status

- **Status:** Training and testing finished
- **Progress:** 40 epochs completed (`0` through `39`) out of 40
- **Dataset:** SSC
- **Model:** SSC_DTH_SE_adLIF
- **Seed:** 42
- **Device:** cuda:0

## Best result

| Metric | Value | Epoch |
|---|---:|---:|
| Best validation accuracy | **80.49%** | 30 |
| Validation loss | **1.0804** | 30 |
| Training accuracy | **85.09%** | 30 |
| Training loss | **0.626270** | 30 |
| Gradient norm | **10.8007** | 30 |
| Learning rate | **0.006** | 30 |

## Model size and computation

| Measurement | Value |
|---|---:|
| Total parameters | **1,691,354** |
| Trainable parameters | **1,689,879** |
| Average padded validation timesteps/sample | **300.00** |
| Estimated dense forward GFLOPs/sample | **1.0087** |

The GFLOPs estimate counts dense feed-forward and recurrent matrix multiply-adds, with one multiply-add equal to two FLOPs. It uses the actual average padded validation sequence length. Elementwise neuron-state updates, loss computation, backward propagation, and data loading are excluded. It is therefore a reproducible forward-compute estimate rather than measured GPU throughput.

## Evaluation note

This run uses `validate_on: validation`. If this is the test split, checkpoint selection is not an unbiased final test evaluation.

## Final test evaluation

The best validation checkpoint was evaluated on the test split after training.

| Metric | Value |

| Synaptic operations/sample | 18,874,907.052056 |
| Analog input dense MACs/sample | 0.000000 |
| Dense matrix GFLOPs/sample | 1.008720 |
| Matrix + scalar arithmetic GFLOPs/sample | 1.025202 |
| Logical GOp/sample | 1.027365 |
| Forward runtime (ms/sample) | 1.913072 |

Activity uses stored sequence lengths including minimum padding/burn-in; compute includes batch padding.
ECG SynOps exclude analog input. Arithmetic excludes nonlinearities/comparisons; logical operations are not hardware FLOPs or energy.
Runtime is forward-only, excluding data loading, transfer, loss and temporal aggregation.
These test measurements are separate from the validation GFLOPs estimate above.

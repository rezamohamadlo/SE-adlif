# Saved test-set activity and cost

Original evaluator version: `shd_costs_v1`. Original JSON preserved byte-for-byte; see `archive/measurement_provenance/RELOCATION.json` for old paths and hashes.

Arithmetic/logical totals absent from the original SHD JSON are derived in memory from its recorded scalar-operation breakdown using the existing report convention. No inference was rerun. Activity uses stored sequence lengths; compute/runtime includes batch padding. Logical operations are not hardware FLOPs or energy.
